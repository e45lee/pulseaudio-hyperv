Message API reference

The message API allows any object within pulseaudio to register a message
handler. A message handler is a function that can be called by clients using
PA_COMMAND_SEND_OBJECT_MESSAGE. A message consists at least of an object path
and a message command, both specified as strings. Additional parameters can
be specified using a single string, but are not mandatory. The message handler
returns an error number as defined in def.h and also returns a string in
the "response" variable. The following reference lists available messages,
their parameters and return values.
