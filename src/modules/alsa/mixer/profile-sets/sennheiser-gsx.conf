# The Sennheiser GSX 1000 and 1200 expose multiple output sinks: A 7.1
# channel surround output, controlled by the main audio knob on the
# device, and a mono output controlled by the smaller knob on the
# side. The intention is to direct chat audio to the mono channel so
# that it can be controlled separately from the main game audio.
