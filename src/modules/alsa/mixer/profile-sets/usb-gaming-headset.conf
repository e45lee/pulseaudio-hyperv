; USB gaming headset.
; These headsets usually have two output devices. The first one is mono,
; meant for voice audio, and the second one is stereo, meant for everything
; else. The purpose of this unusual design is to provide separate volume
; controls for voice and other audio, which can be useful in gaming.
;
; Works with:
; Steelseries Arctis 7
; Steelseries Arctis Pro Wireless.
; Lucidsound LS31
;
; See default.conf for an explanation on the directives used here.
